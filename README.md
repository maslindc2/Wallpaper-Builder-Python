# Wallpaper Creator
Wallpaper creator is a simple python program that stitches images together to create one multi-monitor wallpaper.  The program will automatically resize the provided images to 1920x1080 before stitching.   Wallpaper creator supports the following configurations: dual, triple and stacked. 
## Getting Started
### Requirements
 1. Python 3
 2. Tkinter (used for the file dialog)
 3. Pillow (used for stitching the images together)
### Instructions
 1. Clone this repository or get the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/maslindc2/WallpaperCreator/releases)
2. Ensure you have installed the required packages.  Double click on the python file to run wallpaper generator.  (Note: Since this program uses tkinter for picking the images, running the program from a terminal on windows will cause the program to not work.  You have to launch it from double clicking on the python file)
